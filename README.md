## Summary paragraph:
Neuroendocrine and tuft cells are rare, chemosensory epithelial lineages defined by expression of ASCL1 and POU2F3 transcription factors, respectively. Neuroendocrine cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), frequently display tuft-like subsets, a feature linked to poor patient outcomes. The mechanisms driving neuroendocrine–tuft tumour heterogeneity, and the origins of tuft-like cancers are unknown. Using multiple genetically-engineered animal models of SCLC, we demonstrate that a basal cell of origin (but not the accepted neuroendocrine origin) generates neuroendocrine–tuft-like tumours that highly recapitulate human SCLC. Single-cell clonal analyses of basal-derived SCLC further uncovers unexpected transcriptional states and lineage trajectories underlying neuroendocrine–tuft plasticity. Uniquely in basal cells, introduction of genetic alterations enriched in human tuft-like SCLC, including high MYC, PTEN loss, and ASCL1 suppression, cooperate to promote tuft-like tumours. Transcriptomics of 944 human SCLCs reveal a basal-like subset and a tuft-ionocyte-like state that altogether demonstrate remarkable conservation between cancer states and normal basal cell injury response mechanisms. Together, these data suggest that the basal cell is a plausible origin for SCLC and other neuroendocrine-tuft cancers that can explain neuroendocrine–tuft heterogeneity—offering new insights for targeting lineage plasticity.
